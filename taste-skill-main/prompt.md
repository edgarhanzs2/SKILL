## Image Controller ##
I personally, then generate images using Nano Banana and use https://cxnvert.vercel.app to convert the image files (jfif/png to webp). webp is better for websites, loading faster.
Add the images to your workspace and tell the agent to add them :)
Then continue refining and you should get a nice landingpage/website!
